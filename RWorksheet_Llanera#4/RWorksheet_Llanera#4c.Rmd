```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Use the dataset mpg
a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
```{r}
mpgdata <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
mpgdata
```

 
 2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
Show your answer.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
manufacturer_count <- mpgdata %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(model_count = n_distinct(model)) %>%
  arrange(desc(model_count))

most_models_manufacturer <- manufacturer_count[1, ]

model_variation_count <- mpgdata %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(variation_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(variation_count))

most_variations_model <- model_variation_count[1, ]

most_models_manufacturer
most_variations_model
```



a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
```{r}
unique_models <- mpgdata %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(unique_models = list(unique(model))) %>%
  arrange(manufacturer)

print(unique_models)
```

b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
model_counts <- mpgdata %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(unique_model_count = n_distinct(model)) %>%
  arrange(desc(unique_model_count))


barplot(model_counts$unique_model_count, 
        names.arg = model_counts$manufacturer, 
        las = 2, 
        col = "lightblue", 
        main = "Number of Unique Models by Manufacturer",
        xlab = "Manufacturer", 
        ylab = "Number of Unique Models")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(model_counts, aes(x = reorder(manufacturer, unique_model_count), y = unique_model_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Number of Unique Models by Manufacturer", 
       x = "Manufacturer", 
       y = "Number of Unique Models") +
  theme_minimal()
```
2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the modeland the manufacturer.
a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
-The x-axis represents the model, and the y-axis represents the manufacturer. However, since both are categorical variables, the plot will show points for each model-manufacturer combination. This may lead to numerous overlapping points, making it challenging to identify clear relationships or patterns. As a result, the plot may appear cluttered and may not effectively illustrate the relationship between these variables.
b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?
-As it stands, the plot does little to help understand the relationship between model and manufacturer because of the overplotting of points and the absence of numerical or continuous variables that could offer additional insights.
3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and its results.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
top_20_mpg <- mpgdata %>%
  arrange(desc(cty)) %>%
  head(20)
ggplot(top_20_mpg, aes(x = model, y = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Models by Year", x = "Model", y = "Year") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
\pagebreak
4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result
```{r}
model_counts <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(number_of_cars = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_cars))
print(model_counts)
```
a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs shoudl have a title, labels and colors. Show code and results.
```{r}
top_models <- mpgdata %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(number_of_cars = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_cars)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 20)
ggplot(top_models, aes(x = reorder(model, number_of_cars), y = number_of_cars, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  
  labs(title = "Top 20 Car Models by Number of Cars",
       x = "Car Model",
       y = "Number of Cars",
       fill = "Model") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() 
```
\pagebreak
b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
```{r}
library(viridis)
library(viridisLite)
top_models <- mpgdata %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(number_of_cars = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_cars)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 20)
ggplot(top_models, aes(x = reorder(model, number_of_cars), y = number_of_cars, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Car Models by Number of Cars",
       x = "Car Model",
       y = "Number of Cars") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```
# 5
```{r}
ggplot(mpgdata, aes(x = cyl, y = displ, color = displ)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +  
  labs(title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Engine Displacement") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() 
```
\pagebreak
a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.
-The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between cylinder count and engine displacement, with higher cylinder counts generally linked to greater displacement. Clusters may form by cylinder count, and there can be variability, especially at higher counts. Outliers, such as high displacement with a low cylinder count, may suggest specialized engines.
6. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles per gallon). Mapped
it with a continuous variable you have identified in #1-c. What is its result? Why it produced such
output?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(title = "Relationship between Engine Displacement and Highway MPG",
       x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
       y = "Highway MPG",
       color = "City MPG") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```

6. Import the traffic.csv onto your R environment.
```{r}
library(readr)
traffic_data <- read_csv("traffic.csv")
head(traffic_data)
```
a. How many numbers of observation does it have? What are the variables of the traffic dataset the Show
your answer.
```{r}
num_observations <- nrow(traffic_data)
variables <- colnames(traffic_data)
num_observations
variables
```
b. subset the traffic dataset into junctions. What is the R codes and its output?
```{r}
junctions_data <- subset(traffic_data, Junction == TRUE)
head(junctions_data)
```

c. Plot each junction in a using geom_line(). Show your solution and output.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(traffic_data, aes(x = DateTime, y = Vehicles, color = factor(Junction))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Vehicle Counts at Junctions Over Time",
       x = "Date and Time",
       y = "Number of Vehicles",
       color = "Junction") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
7. From alexa_file.xlsx, import it to your environment
a. How many observations does alexa_file has? What about the number of columns? Show your solution and answer.
```{r}
library(readxl)
alexa_data <- read_excel("alexa_file.xlsx")
dimensions <- dim(alexa_data)
num_rows <- dimensions[1]
num_columns <- dimensions[2]
num_rows
num_columns  
```

b. group the variations and get the total of each variations. Use dplyr package. Show solution and
answer.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
variation_totals <- alexa_data %>%
  group_by(variation) %>%
  summarise(total = n())
variation_totals
```
\
c. Plot the variations using the ggplot() function. What did you observe? Complete the details of the
graph. Show solution and answer.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(variation_totals, aes(x = variation, y = total, fill = variation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

  theme_minimal()
```

d. Plot a geom_line() with the date and the number of verified reviews. Complete the details of the graphs. Show your answer and solution.
```{r}
alexa_data$verified_reviews <- as.numeric(alexa_data$verified_reviews)
reviews_by_date <- alexa_data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_verified_reviews = sum(verified_reviews, na.rm = TRUE))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(reviews_by_date, aes(x = date, y = total_verified_reviews)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Verified Reviews Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Number of Verified Reviews") +
  theme_minimal()

e. Get the relationship of variations and ratings. Which variations got the most highest in rating? Plot a
graph to show its relationship. Show your solution and answer.
```{r}
variation_ratings <- alexa_data %>%

  labs(title = "Average Rating by Variation", x = "Variation", y = "Average Rating") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
