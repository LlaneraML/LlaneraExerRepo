## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
 
 1. Vector Age  
```{r}
age <- c (34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,
51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
length(age)
```
2.Values for Age
```{r}
age <- c (34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,
51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
reciprocal_age <- 1/ age
print(reciprocal_age)

```
3.New Age 
```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
         35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49,
         50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51,
         35, 24, 33, 41)

new_age <- c(age, 0, age)
print(new_age)
```
4.Sort Age 
```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
         35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49,
         50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51,
         35, 24, 33, 41)
sortage <- sort(age)
print(sortage)
```
5.Maximum and Minimum Age
```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
         35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49,
         50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51,
         35, 24, 33, 41)
age_min <- min(age)
max_age <- max(age)
print(age_min)
print(max_age)
```
6.Vector Data
```{r}
data <- c(2.4, 2.8, 2.1, 2.5, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5,
2.3, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7)
length(data)
```
7. Double Data
```{r}
data <- c(2.4, 2.8, 2.1, 2.5, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5,
2.3, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7)
double_data <- data * 2
print(double_data)
```
8. Sequence
- 8.1
```{r}
seq(1:100)
```
- 8.2
```{r}
seq(20:60)
```
- 8.3
```{r}
mean(20:60)
```
- 8.4
```{r}
sum(51:91)
```
- 8.5
```{r}
seq(1:1000)
```
9.Filter
```{r}
Filter(function(i) { all(i %% c(3,5,7) != 0) }, seq(100))
```
10.Backward Sequence
```{r}
rev(1:100)
```
11. List all the natural numbers below 25 that are multiples of 3 or 5.
```{r}
numero <- 1:25
multiples <- numero[numero %% 3== 0 | numero %% 5 == 0]
multiples
sum <- sum(multiples)
sum
```
11.a 
```{r}
num <- 10:11
count <- length(num)
count
```
12. Statements can be grouped together using braces ‘{’ and ‘}’. A group of statements
is sometimes called a block. Single statements are evaluated when a new line is typed
at the end of the syntactically complete statement. Blocks are not evaluated until a
new line is entered after the closing brace.
Enter this statement:
x <- {0 + x + 5 + }
Describe the output.
the Output is a syntax error for the particular reason that the statements ends in a + and was not given another value . 

13. *Set up a vector named score, consisting of 72, 86, 92, 63, 88, 89, 91, 92, 75,
75 and 77. To access individual elements of an atomic vector, one generally uses the
x[i] construction.
Find x[2] and x[3]. Write the R code and its output.
```{r}
score <- c(72, 86, 92, 63, 88, 89, 91, 92, 75)
score[2]
score[3]
```
14. *Create a vector a = c(1,2,NA,4,NA,6,7).
a. Change the NA to 999 using the codes print(a,na.print="-999").

b. Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.
```{r}
a = c(1,2,NA,4,NA,6,7)
print(a,na.print="-999")
```
the function makes the display the na values as -999 in the output. even though, it doesnt replace the na within the vector but only affects the output. 

15.A special type of function calls can appear on the left hand side of the assignment
operator as in > class(x) <- "foo".

```{r}
name = readline(prompt="Input your name: ")
age = readline(prompt="Input your age: ")
print(paste("My name is",name, "and I am",age ,"years old."))
print(R.version.string)
```
the output is "My name is Marco Luis Llanera and I am 19 years old."
"R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)"

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
