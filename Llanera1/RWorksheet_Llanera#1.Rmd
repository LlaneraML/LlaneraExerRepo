## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
 
 1. Vector Age  
```{r}
age <- c (34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,
51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
length(age)
```
2.Values for Age
```{r}
age <- c (34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,
51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
reciprocal_age <- 1/ age
print(reciprocal_age)

```
3.New Age 
```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
         35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49,
         50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51,
         35, 24, 33, 41)

new_age <- c(age, 0, age)
print(new_age)
```
4.Sort Age 
```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
         35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49,
         50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51,
         35, 24, 33, 41)
sortage <- sort(age)
print(sortage)
```
5.Maximum and Minimum Age
```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
         35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49,
         50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51,
         35, 24, 33, 41)
age_min <- min(age)
max_age <- max(age)
print(age_min)
print(max_age)
```
6.Vector Data
```{r}
data <- c(2.4, 2.8, 2.1, 2.5, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5,
2.3, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7)
length(data)
```
7. Double Data
```{r}
data <- c(2.4, 2.8, 2.1, 2.5, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5,
2.3, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7)
double_data <- data * 2
print(double_data)
```
8. Sequence
- 8.1
```{r}
seq(1:100)
```
- 8.2
```{r}
seq(20:60)
```
- 8.3
```{r}
mean(20:60)
```
- 8.4
```{r}
sum(51:91)
```
- 8.5
```{r}
seq(1:1000)
```
9.Filter
```{r}
Filter(function(i) { all(i %% c(3,5,7) != 0) }, seq(100))
```
10.Backward Sequence
```{r}
rev(1:100)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
