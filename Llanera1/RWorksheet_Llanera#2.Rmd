```

1.Create a vector using : operator
a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output.
Describe its output.

```{r}
seq_a <- -5:5
print(seq_a)
```
b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
```{r}
x <- 1:7
x
```
2. Create a vector using seq() function
a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
Write the R script and its output. Describe the output.
```{r}
 seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
seq
```
it made a seq from 1 to 3 but it was incremented to sequence by 0.2 so the sequence was a little bit longer. 

3. A factory has a census of its workers. There are 50 workers in total. The following
list shows their ages: 34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35,
24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26,
18.

1

a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?
```{r}
listako <- list(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18.)
print(listako[3])
```

b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
```{r}
listako <- list(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18.)
print(listako[c(2 , 4)])
```

c. Access all but the 4th and 12th element is not
included. Write the R script and its output.
```{r}
listako <- list(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18.)
print(listako[-c(4 , 12)])
```

4. *Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the vector, names(x).
```{r}
names <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
```

a. Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")].
Describe the output.
```{r}
names <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
names[c(1, 3)]
```
+ The output is shown with  its value.
b. Write the code and its output.
```{r}
names <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
names
```

5. Create a sequence x from -3:2.
```{r}
x <- -3:2
x
```

a. Modify 2nd element and change it to 0;
x[2] <- 0
x
```{r}
x <- -3:2
x[2] <- 0
x
```

Describe the output.
+ The second output value is changed into 0 even though the 2nd value is changed the original sequence is not affected but only the 2nd value.
b. Write the code and its output.
```{r}
x <- -3:2
x
```
6. *The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.
a. Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php)
and purchase-quantity (liter). Write the R scripts and
its output.
```{r}
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")
Php <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
liter <- c(25, 30, 40, 50 ,10, 45)
fuel_data <- data.frame(month, Php, liter)
fuel_data
```
b. What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from
Jan to June? Note: Use ‘weighted.mean(liter,
purchase)‘. Write the R scripts and its output.
```{r}
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")
Php <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
liter <- c(25, 30, 40, 50 ,10, 45)
avg <- weighted.mean(Php, liter)
avg
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
